This is a simple widget that converts any pdf to a new one where each page is replaced by images. 

Purpose: make it harder for anyone to copycat a document.

Pros: the outuput is pretty small and has perfect resolution since it turns each pdf page to a png img.

Cons: the function doesn't work in memory, so it has to create a temporary folder wherever you are working. The in-memory method is shared in the notebook, but i couldn't find a way to conver pixmap to png in memory.

Future Work: add an invisible noise to images to affect OCR performance. (Already tried something but without success)
